/**
 * ROOTS-AI(TM) Phase 1 MVP - Controlled canonical source descriptor.
 *
 * Controlled sources:
 *   - C-01 Canonical Question Bank v1.0.1 CORRECTED   (questionnaire)
 *   - C-02 Canonical Scoring Rules & Golden Tests v1.0.1 CORRECTED (scoring)
 *
 * This module is the SINGLE place where the canonical version identifiers and
 * the canonical domain model are declared. Every other module derives from it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (M2 control rule): the values in `domainModel` below must reproduce
 * the controlled C-02 v1.0.1 source exactly. They are declared here as data so
 * that the deterministic engine contains no hidden domain assumptions and so
 * that a corrected source version can be adopted by editing this one block.
 *
 * NOTE: The C-01 / C-02 XLSX files are the canonical executable sources. When
 * they are ingested (scripts/ingest-canonical.ts) the generated JSON they
 * produce is checked against this descriptor and the declared versions must
 * match. No generated value may be hand-edited away from its source.
