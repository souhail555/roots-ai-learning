 * Canonical immutable report object.

 *
 * IMPORTANT — M3 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
 * ------------------------------------
 * The *deterministic spine* of this object is implemented and authoritative:
 * the report identity, the frozen scoring snapshot, the seven-domain breakdown,
 * drivers, version identity and the content hash are all derived mechanically
 * from the C-02 scoring result and cannot be altered by AI or by the UI.
 *
 * The *governed narrative/content layer* (`sections`, `governedContent`,
 * `roadmap`, `protectiveFactors`) is structured but its exact section titles,
 * ordering, explanatory copy and fallback wording are controlled by
 * C-03 v1.0.1 CORRECTED, which was NOT available in this workspace at
 * implementation time. Every such field is therefore marked with
 * `governedSourceAvailable: false` and carries an explicit
 * `UNAVAILABLE:` placeholder rather than invented copy.
 *
 * Do not treat the narrative placeholders as the delivered report content.
 * They exist so that the integrity, immutability and parity guarantees can be
 * built and tested now, and so the governed copy can be dropped in later
 * without touching the deterministic spine.
