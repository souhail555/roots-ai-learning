 * Controlled AI narrative boundary.

 *  - Regulatory Readiness Annex (Vendor-Core AI governance)
 *  - C-03 v1.0.1 CORRECTED (governed report content / interpretation sources)
 *
 * GOVERNANCE INVARIANTS (enforced in code, not by convention)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 *  1. AI runs only AFTER deterministic scoring is finalised, and receives only
 *     the read-only projection. Raw answers are never passed to the model.
 *  2. The AI output schema carries NARRATIVE FIELDS ONLY. There is no key in
 *     the schema through which a score, classification, driver, threshold or
 *     eligibility decision could be expressed or written back.
 *  3. Any returned object containing a score-bearing key is rejected outright.
 *  4. Any narrative containing prohibited diagnostic / prescriptive / alarmist /
 *     certainty language is rejected, and the governed fallback is used.
 *  5. Any numeric value in the narrative that is not present in the projection
 *     is treated as a hallucinated value and rejected.
 *  6. Timeout, transport failure, malformed output or governance rejection all
 *     resolve to the deterministic governed fallback. A valid deterministic
 *     result is therefore never lost because narrative generation failed.
 *  7. The AI path has no reference to the scoring result object and no storage
 *     handle; it cannot mutate the authoritative record.
